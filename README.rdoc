## Notes
* Plot time interval is 5min (10 min is not an option)
* Updated every 5 seconds, depending on internet connection
* Yahoo was bought out by Verizon, and is now called Altaba
* NYSE date ranges from 9:30 to 16:00 due to business hours. So 6 hours past data is not always availible, or we get a step between days. Keeping it to last 72 points rather. Assumes no holidays.
